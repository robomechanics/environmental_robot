autonomy_manager, gps_user_input.py and pxrf.py
- pxrf change timings


# TODO
- WAITING_FOR_CALIBRATION_TO_FINISH: Need to wait for RTK GPS to be initialized. May be change it to WAITING_FOR_GPS_INIT
- the first STANDBY state can be changed to INIT

# gps_navigation
The gps_navigation package contains the source code for waypoint navigation and GUI.
To launch: please run `roslaunch gps_naviation navigate_no_rviz.launch`

The following files in the src are used:

	gps_user_location.py:
It both parses the locations.csv to extract the coordinate information. It can also take the input from the user and store the coordinate in the locations.csv file so that it can be easily accessed in the future

	gps_user_input.py:
The main GUI that uses PyQT as the library that displays the regional map. It allows the user to place pins on the map, control pxrf, monitor robot status, etc

	gps_navigation.py:
The main controller for waypoint navigation. It includes both LQR and PID controllers. Currently only PID controller is used. LQR controller is not well tuned.



# Programming Environment

## Terminal Info
- zsh is the default terminal. 
- Instead of .bashrc, use .zshrc file to add aliases, source rosfiles, etc
- Run `tmux` after ssh to easily create new tmux session. A tmux session allows you to create remote terminals wihtout having to repeatedly ssh again.

## Aliases
The following aliases use incremental search to list the packages, topics and nodes.
- rcd -> roscd
- rte -> rostopic echo
- rtinfo -> rostopic info
- rnkill -> rosnode kill

## Shortcuts:
- CTRL + Space : Accept autosuggestion in the terminal
- CTRL + L : Clear terminal
- CTRL + R : Incrementally search history
- ` is the prefix key for tmux. After pressing the prefix key, press the following for:
  - | : Split current terminal horizontally
  - -- : Split current temrinal vertically
  - c : New terminal
  - x : Close current terminal
  - s : Switch session
